  "Functions to handle structured data formatted as CBOR.

  Special types are handled by plugins which define three important attributes
  to support serializing a type to and from CBOR. A plugin map should contain:

  - `:reader` a function which converts a literal form into a value of this type.
  - `:writers` a map of classes or other interfaces to functions which return
    the literal form for a value of that type.
  - `:description` human-readable text about the type.

  The collection of data type plugins maps the symbol _tag_ for each type to
  the plugin for that type."
